This is the initial release of sbt-man.

Add the following to your ~/.sbt/plugins/build.sbt:

    addSbtPlugin("com.eed3si9n" % "sbt-man" % "0.1.0")

This adds `man` command, which looks up the scaladoc of Scala and Scalaz using Scalex and displays the first result:

    > man Traversable /:
    [man] scala.collection.Traversable
    [man] def /:[B](z: B)(op: (B ⇒ A ⇒ B)): B
    [man] Applies a binary operator to a start value and all elements of this
    collection, going left to right. Note: /: is alternate syntax for foldLeft;
    z /: xs is the same as xs foldLeft z. Note: will not terminate for infinite-
    sized collections. Note: might return different results for different runs,
    unless the underlying collection type is ordered. or the operator is
    associative and commutative.
